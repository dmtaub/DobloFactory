DOBLO: DUPLO-compatible scenery factory

todo: 
- Use write.scad for better text support
- enable rounded-top nibbles for doblo
- CADRO BLOCKS!
- Use MCAD for support of gears and other mechanical elements?
- More UniversalConnectorKit-like aspects?

Version 2.1 - jan 2013
- includes stls for test-import.scad to make duplo pieces, with attribution
- change authorship order
- including newest version of Z-axis hinge in connectors library

Version 2.0 - oct 2012
- modularized and source-controlled
- functional passing of scale for each element
- allows mixing of doblo and lego sizes in one model

Version 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 - oct 2012
- fixed some bugs
- increased size of duplo bottom-nibbles a tiny bit
- made it somewhat 0.25 SCALE compatible

Version 1.8.1 - Sept 10 2012
- added a grid on underneath the bridges that will stabilize nibbles and maybe help printing a duplo block with a high resolution printer. If set to 0, it will not print this lattice. The result underneath will remain ugly with a lattice, but the model is easier to print.
- fixed a bug I totally missed (uneven blocks, e.g. 3x3 had missing nibbles underneath)
- Multiplied parameters for better calibration
- Added an easy to print base plate (revised for 1.8.1)

Version 1.6 - May 1 2012
- added lozenges aka diamonds (optional) to the low end of walls for ABS printing
- adapted constants for 0.25mm printing (felixprinter, fabbster)

Version 1.5 - 2011
- bugfixes

Version 1.3 - May 1 2010
- Added better Lego compatibility
- Still not fully tested
- Set the SCALE variable in your module file, else the module will exit with an error !!
